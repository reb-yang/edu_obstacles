      <description>There’s not a lot of things I would consider myself an expert in — definitely not an expert in ggplot or making graphs. But, I am 100% confident in declaring myself an expert in all things Taylor Swift.
Thus, it’s only fitting that my very first Tidy Tuesday project is about Taylor Swift lyrics. This data comes from Rosie Baillie and Dr. Sara Stoudt. I was inspired by Rosie’s original post (the bulk of my code is from her), where she analyzed sentiments and emotions for the songs and albums.</description>
